yum repolist
sudo rpm -Uvh https://yum.puppet.com/puppet5-release-el-7.noarch.rpm
yum list | grep -i puppet 
from the filtered list choose "PUPPET-AGENT-86*6svnskdj"                  #Change the contents inside the quotes"
yum install "PUPPET-AGENT-86*6svnskdj"                                    #Change the contents inside the quotes"
systemctl start puppet #starting the agent service 
systemctl status puppet #checking the status 
ln -s /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet /usr/bin/puppet #create puppet binary command using the below soft link
copy the FQDN of master and agent hosts then put the below sample config file in /etc/puppetlabs/puppet/puppet.config


[main]
certname = FQDN name of agent server
server = FQDN name of puppet server

service ntpd status #check the status of ntpd service before for just to verify service is not installed already

puppet agent -tv -noop #check the changes and test the manifest from puppet master
puppet agent -tv #this will apply the changes from master server 

service ntpd status
now the service will be running





what is ntpd ?
The ntpd program is an operating system daemon which sets and maintains the system time of day in synchronism with Internet standard time servers. 
It is a complete implementation of the Network Time Protocol (NTP) version 4, but also retains compatibility with version 3, as defined by RFC-1305, and version 1 and 2, as defined by RFC-1059 and RFC-1119, respectively. 
ntpd does most computations in 64-bit floating point arithmetic and does relatively clumsy 64-bit fixed point operations only when necessary to preserve the ultimate precision, about 232 picoseconds. 
While the ultimate precision is not achievable with ordinary workstations and networks of today, it may be required with future gigahertz CPU clocks and gigabit LANs.

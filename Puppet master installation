Download puppet repo from https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/5.5/puppet_platform.html#apt-based-systems or use the below commands directly 
Linux distros - sudo rpm -Uvh https://yum.puppet.com/puppet5-release-el-7.noarch.rpm
Unix distros - wget https://apt.puppetlabs.com/puppet5-release-xenial.deb, sudo dpkg -i puppet5-release-xenial.deb, sudo apt update
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Puppet server/master installation in Linux distro (CentOS)

yum repolist
sudo rpm -Uvh https://yum.puppet.com/puppet5-release-el-7.noarch.rpm
yum list | grep -i puppet 
from the filtered list choose "puppetserver"
yum install "puppetserver--------"
systemctl start puppetserver #starting the master service 
systemctl status puppetserver #checking the status 
ln -s /opt/puppetlabs/bin/puppet /usr/bin/puppet #create puppet binary command using the below soft link
puppet cert list -all #to check list of certs in puppet master 
touch /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp #creating site.pp file in manifests to install ntpd service 
vi /etc/puppetlabs/code/environments/production/manifests/site.pp #edit the file with the below contents

# class def
class ntpdemo {
 #install 
   package { "ntp":
   ensure => "present",
   }
# configure the ntpd service 
  file { "/etc/ntp.conf":
     ensure => "present",
     content => "server 0.centos.pool.ntp.org iburst\n"
  }
# start ntpd service
   service { "ntpd":
   ensure => "running",
  }
}
include ntpdemo



[IMP] follow the below steps after installing puppet server 
puppet cert list -all #check whether agent cert is loaded to master 
puppet cert sign "FQDN of agent using hostname -i" #sign the cert to allow the secure connection 
puppet cert list -all #now "+" will be added infront of agent 

other commands
puppet cert unsign "FQDN" and cleanup ssl directory in agent node using rm -rf command 
the restart puppet-agent in agnet node using "puppet agent -tv"
